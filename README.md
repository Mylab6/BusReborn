A basic bus stop location app, designed to work with LA's metro API , but can be easily adjusted for other transit agencies . For use with Pg_GTFS.

I have it configured to work with my own heroku deployment of PG_GFTS. 

You need to sign up for an api key with Google for the built in map, delete the existing strings sample file and create a strings file with the needed keys.
